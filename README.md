# The code and data that supports the research work: "Deep Complex Convolutional Network in ad-hoc reconstruction of Fat and Water maps using Multi-Echo GRE in Magnetic Resonance Imaging". 

## Steps to run the code and see the results:
### 1. Clone the entire repository 
### 2. Open the IPYNB Notebook named: "MRI_Fat_Water_Seperation_With_DCCN"
### 3. Update the path for the root directory where the repository files are present in the opened IPYNB Notebook.
### 4. Start running the cells one-by-one till the end. 

## Codes for both U-Net ad-hoc reconstruction and DCCN ad-hoc reconstruction are present in the IPYNB Notebook, along with the codes to Qualitatively and Quantitatively compare their results.
